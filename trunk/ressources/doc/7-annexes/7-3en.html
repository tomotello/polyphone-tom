<p align="justify">The sf3 format, developed by <a href="https://musescore.org">MuseScore<img src="qrc:/icones/external_link.gif" /></a>, is similar in all respects to the <a href="qrc:/aide/7-0en.html">sf2</a> format except that the <a href="qrc:/aide/4-1en.html">samples</a> are stored in the OGG format (like the MP3 format but open source) instead of being stored as raw data. The consequence is that the sf3 format is about 10 times lighter than the sf2 format for a comparable quality.</p>

<p align="justify">A soundfont exported in this format is not intended to be edited later because successive compressions would result in a lower sound quality. This format should be seen as a final product and is very interesting for all end users of soundfonts in that:
<ul>
    <li>downloads are made easier on internet,</li>
    <li>space is saved in computers,</li>
    <li>the combination midi + sf3 provides a lightweight and powerful solution to play soundtracks (video games, mobile applications, ...).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p align="justify">Unlike the <a href="http://www.fmjsoft.com/fmt/sf2pack.htm">sf2pack<img src="qrc:/icones/external_link.gif" /></a> format which answers the same issues, the sf3 format is entirely open-source. The source code is available, thus ensuring its perenity (let's avoid the mistakes done with sfArk or sfPack!).
