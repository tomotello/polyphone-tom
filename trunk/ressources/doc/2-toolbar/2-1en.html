<p align="justify">The virtual keyboard allows us to test the current sample, instrument or preset. It can be controlled in three ways:
<ul>
	<li><b>with the mouse</b><br />
	The desired key may be clicked by the mouse. The velocity is defined according to the vertical position of the click.</li>
	<li><b>using the computer keyboard</b><br />
	The keys and the velocity used are defined in the <a href="qrc:/aide/6-4en.html">settings</a>.</li>
	<li><b>using an external keyboard</b><br />
	The MIDI input is defined in the <a href="qrc:/aide/6-0en.html">settings</a>.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Markers and colors</h3>
<p align="justify">
<ul>
	<li>When an <a href="qrc:/aide/4-2en.html">instrument</a> or a <a href="qrc:/aide/4-3en.html">preset</a> is selected, the area not covered by the divisions are <b>grayed</b>. It is thus possible to visualize the full range of an instrument or a preset.</li>
	<li>When a division of an instrument or a preset is selected, its range is displayed the same way than above. Moreover, its root key is identified by an <b>orange marker</b>.</li>
	<li>When a key is selected on the keyboard, it appears in <b>blue</b>. Moreover, the range of its corresponding range(s) appears in <b>yellow</b>. This applies only at the instrument level.</li>
	<li>Middle C is identified by a <b>black marker</b>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Usefull shortcuts</h3>

<p align="justify"><ul>
	<li><b>"Ctrl + K"</b><br />
	This shortcut can put at any time the focus on the virtual keyboard. This allows, while editing in a table for instance, to use the computer to play instead of edit a cell.</li>
	<li><b>"Ctrl + 1", "Ctrl + 2", ... "Ctrl + 8"</b><br />
	These shortcuts change the octaves played with the computer keyboard. After the use of "Ctrl + 1", the lowest octave can be played. The highest octave is reached using "Ctrl + 8".</li>
	<li><b>Right / Left</b><br />
	The right or left arrow will play the pitch just next or below the last key that has been played, with the same velocity. The association of the key "shift" skips keys.</li>
	<li><b>Up / Down</b><br />
	The up or down arrow will play the same pitch than the last key played, but with a stronger or weaker velocity. The association of the key "shift" skips velocities.</li>
</ul></p>
