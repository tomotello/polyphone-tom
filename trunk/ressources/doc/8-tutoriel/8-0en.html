<h3>Sample loading</h3>

<p align="justify">The sample preparation begins by <b>loading</b> .wav files. To do this first select the "Samples" category in the <a href="qrc:/aide/3en.html">tree</a> and either select "Import samples" from the "<a href="qrc:/aide/1-0en.html">File</a>" menu, or right-click on the "Samples" category and select "New sample". Samples may be obtained:
<ul>
	<li>through Internet,</li>
	<li>by recording a real musical instrument,</li>
	<li>by synthesis using a specialized software.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Sample looping</h3>

<p align="justify">Next, a <b>loop</b> may be required in the sample, if you would like it to sound longer than its normal length. An example of this would be if you only have a 1 second flute sample, but would like it to sound indefinitely. This can be done by manually or automatically assigning loop points (start + end) within the sample boundaries, so that the loop area can be repeated and thus make the sample play longer.  While you can assign loop points manually, using the "<a href="qrc:/aide/5-0-1en.html">Auto loop</a>" function to assign them automatically usually produces better results and is a lot faster.</p>

<p align="justify">To assign loop points manually:
<ul>
	<li>click in the <a href="qrc:/aide/3en.html">tree</a> on the sample to be looped,</li>
	<li>in the editing page of <a href="qrc:/aide/4-1en.html">samples</a>, arbitrarily position the start and end of the loop in the <a href="qrc:/aide/4-1-0en.html">graphic</a> (WAV display area) unless a loop is already defined. Use left-click for start and right-click for end. The right loop point should be entered first (since the left point it by default at the position 0 and that it's not possible to assign a right point before the left point).</li>
	<li>press the "Play" button after having selected the loop function,</li>
	<li>adjust the start and / or end of the loop, while the sample is playing, until the transition between the two positions is as smooth as possible.</li>
</ul>
To assign loop points automatically, see the "<a href="qrc:/aide/5-0-1en.html">Auto loop</a>" function in the menu "Tools" &#8594; "Samples".
</p>

<p align="justify">Note: To hear looping in an instrument, you must enter a <b>1</b> in the "Loop playback" parameter row of either the Global or individual notes columns in the <a href="qrc:/aide/4-2-0en.html">Parameters Table</a>. <b>1</b> turns it On, <b>0</b> or a blank turns it Off.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="qrc:/aide/loop_illustration.png" /></p>

<h3>Sample tuning</h3>

<p align="justify">Finally, a <b>tuning</b> has to be done. To do this, a calibration tool (Sinus) is available in the editing page of <a href="qrc:/aide/4-1en.html">samples</a>. For each sample the method is as follows:
<ul>
	<li>begin the playback (press the "play" button), if possible with loop function selected,</li>
	<li>select the sinus function,</li>
	<li>adjust the volume slider to hear the two sounds as clearly as possible,</li>
	<li>change the Root key until the two sounds most closely match,</li>
	<li>adjust the Correction (cents) to tune the sample to the Rootkey. To do this, pay attention to any beats that occur and make sure they are as slow as possible.</li>
</ul>
The <a href="qrc:/aide/4-1-2en.html">frequency</a> analysis can be a good indicator to start tuning.
</p>

<h3>To go further</h3>

<p align="justify">Several tools are available to edit samples like:
<ul>
	<li><a href="qrc:/aide/5-0-3en.html">removing blank</a> at start,</li>
	<li><a href="qrc:/aide/4-1-3en.html">equalizing</a> the sound,</li>
	<li><a href="qrc:/aide/5-0-7en.html">transposing</a>,</li>
	<li><a href="qrc:/aide/5-0-5en.html">normalizing</a> the volume,</li>
	<li><a href="qrc:/aide/5-0-6en.html">adjusting the balance</a> for stereo samples.</li>
</ul>
</p>
