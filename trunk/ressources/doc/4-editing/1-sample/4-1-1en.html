<p align="justify">The section "Information" allows the editing of the following information:
<ul>
	<li>start and end of the loop,</li>
	<li>rootkey of the sample,</li>
	<li>correction to be applied for the sound to be tuned in the equal temperament,</li>
	<li>sound sample rate (a change will cause resampling),</li>
	<li>sound type (not linked: mono, otherwise left, right or linked),</li>
	<li>the linked sample if the sample is stereo.</li>
</ul>
In addition, the sample size in samples (number of values) and seconds is shown.</p>

<p align="justify">
A button automatically edits the start and end of the loop so that the loop is the entire sample. Another button automatically edits the rootkey and the correction so that they match with the evaluation of the <a href="qrc:/aide/4-1-2en.html">frequency</a>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Any change on a stereo sample may be applied on the linked sample if the option is ticked in the <a href="qrc:/aide/6-2en.html">preferences</a>. Via a multiple selection in the <a href="qrc:/aide/3en.html">tree</a>, several samples may be edited simultaneously.
