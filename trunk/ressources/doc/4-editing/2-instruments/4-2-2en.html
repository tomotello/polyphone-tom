<p align="justify">Each sample is represented by a green rectangle. The color is semitransparent, so that the superposition of several elements is identifiable. By maintaining the left click you can:
<ul>
  <li>change the size of a rectangle, when the mouse is over one of the edges or a rectangle;</li>
  <li>change the position of a rectangle, by pointing to the center of a rectangle.</li>
</ul>
When several rectangles are superimposed, a left simple click changes the selection. Maintaining the right click allows you to change the zoom.
