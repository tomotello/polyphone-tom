<p align="justify">The software seeks a stable area of the sample and then artificially creates a loop. A sound segment is copied with a crossfade, so that the transition at the join location is as smooth as possible.</p>

<p align="justify">To assign loop points automatically:
<ul>
	<li>click in the <a href="qrc:/aide/3en.html">tree</a> on the sample to be looped,</li>
	<li>in the editing page of <a href="qrc:/aide/4-1en.html">samples</a>:
	<ul>
		<li>position the start and end of the loop in the graphic (WAV display area) around a stable area, or</li>
		<li>let the tool determine automatically a stable area by defining 0 as loop start and loop end,</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>in the "Tools" menu select "Sample", "Auto loop",</li>
	<li>press the Play button with the loop option checked,</li>
	<li>if the loop points found are not suitable you can <a href="qrc:/aide/1-1en.html">undo</a> the operation, try repositioning them manually around a stable area and then use the "Auto loop" function again.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p align="justify">The tool needs to find a stable area of more than 0.25 seconds. If it fails, a warning message appears indicating that no loop can be found. In this case it is possible to specify manually a stable area of more than 0.25 seconds and retry the tool, or try to find the loop points manually.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Warning:</b> This tool modifies the original sample. Modifications can be undone via the "<a href="qrc:/aide/1-1en.html">undo</a>" function, but if the file is saved and Polyphone is closed there is no way to step back.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Note:</b> By default, the looping is disabled in an instrument. To hear it, you must enter a "1" in the Loop playback parameter row of either the Global or individual notes columns in the Parameters Table. "1" turns it On, "0" turns it Off. The value "3" turns the looping On and the sample will play to the end after a key is released.
