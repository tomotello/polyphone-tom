<p align="justify">This tool is used to apply a filter to break all frequencies whose intensity is above a threshold. The threshold is defined according to three parameters:
<ul>
	<li>the frequency at which the filter begins to act,</li>
	<li>the frequency at which the filter is complete,</li>
	<li>the stiffness defining the evolution of the threshold between the two previous frequencies (linear or with a sudden drop).</li>
</ul>
